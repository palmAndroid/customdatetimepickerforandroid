Welcome

This little pet project was inspired by http://code.google.com/p/android-dateslider/
The dateslider was overkill for my needs, so I made a custom adapter and helper methods for android's builtin Gallery widget.

It's lightviewght, easy to customize, currently lacking some fancy features, like custom animation, but that might be added later.<br>

Usage:<br>
There is an example activity with a lot of comments in the source code.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
I reused the background of the dateslider (the file at project folder/res/drawable-mdpi/slider_back.xml).<br>
